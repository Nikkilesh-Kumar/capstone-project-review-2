    </br> <p>Botulism is a rare and potentially fatal illness caused by a toxin produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum.[1] The disease begins with weakness, blurred vision, feeling tired, and trouble speaking.[1] This may then be followed by weakness of the arms, chest muscles, and legs.[1] Vomiting, swelling of the abdomen, and diarrhea may also occur.[1] The disease does not usually affect consciousness or cause a fever.[1]

        Botulism can be spread in several ways.[1] The bacterial spores which cause it are common in both soil and water.[1] They produce the botulinum toxin when exposed to low oxygen levels and certain temperatures.[1] Foodborne botulism happens when food containing the toxin is eaten.[1] Infant botulism happens when the bacteria develops in the intestines and releases the toxin.[1] This typically only occurs in children less than six months old, as protective mechanisms develop after that time.[1] Wound botulism is found most often among those who inject street drugs.[1] In this situation, spores enter a wound, and in the absence of oxygen, release the toxin.[1] It is not passed directly between people.[1] The diagnosis is confirmed by finding the toxin or bacteria in the person in question.[1]
        
        Prevention is primarily by proper food preparation.[1] The toxin, though not the organism, is destroyed by heating it to more than 85 °C (185 °F) for longer than 5 minutes.[1] Honey can contain the organism, and for this reason, honey should not be fed to children under 12 months.[1] Treatment is with an antitoxin.[1] In those who lose their ability to breathe on their own, mechanical ventilation may be necessary for months.[1] Antibiotics may be used for wound botulism.[1] Death occurs in 5 to 10% of people.[1] Botulism also affects many other animals.[1] The word is from Latin botulus, meaning sausage.[4] Early descriptions of botulism date from at least as far back as 1793 in Germany.[5]</p>
